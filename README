Present Domesday Book data as a map usable for a game.

Use API from http://opendomesday.org/api/ to load basic data.

Current display idea is to propose a React/Flux interface with
 * a map powered by pixi.js renderer (supports canvas/webGL)
 * informative React components, on places, lords, etc.
 * bootstrap css with a navbar allowing to go into admin views
 * django server backend

It is possible to execute the following commands to avoid reloading all data from OpenDomesday website:
 * python manage.py loaddata map_DomesdayData.json
 * python manage.py loadmap --actions local
