Present Domesday book data as a map usable for a game.

Use API from http://opendomesday.org/api/ to load it.

Current display idea is to propose a React/Flux interface with
 * a map powered by pixi.js renderer (supports canvas/webGL)
 * informative React components, on places, lords, etc.
 * bootstrap css with a navbar allowing to go into admin views
 * django server backend
